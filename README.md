# ninja
My first ninja shooting game created with python3 pygame 

run it using this command `python3 ninja.py` or `python3 ninjav2.py`

# Error? module not found?
install pygame module with this command `pip3 install pygame`

# pip3 command not found? in linux Os
install it with `apt install python3-pip`

# python3 command not found? in linux Os
install it with `apt install python3`

run it with root if necessary.
